# Mediator Design Pattern

The Mediator pattern provides central authority over a group of objects by encapsulating how these objects interact. This model is useful for scenarios where there is a need to manage complex conditions in which every object is aware of any state change in any other object in the group.

The Mediator patterns are useful in the development of complex forms. Take for example a page in which you enter options to make a flight reservation. A simple Mediator rule would be: you must enter a valid departure date, a valid return date, the return date must be after the departure date, a valid departure airport, a valid arrival airport, a valid number of travelers, and only then the Search button can be activated.

Another example of Mediator is that of a control tower on an airport coordinating arrivals and departures of airplanes.
