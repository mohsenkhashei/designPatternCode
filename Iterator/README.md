# Iterator Design Pattern

The Iterator pattern allows clients to effectively loop over a collection of objects

A common programming task is to traverse and manipulate a collection of objects. These collections may be stored as an array or perhaps something more complex, such as a tree or graph structure. In addition, you may need to access the items in the collection in a certain order, such as, front to back, back to front, depth first (as in tree searches), skip evenly numbered objects, etc.

## Usage

check index
and run

```bash
`ts-node index`
```
