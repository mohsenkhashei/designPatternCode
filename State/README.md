# State Design Pattern

The State pattern provides state-specific logic to a limited set of objects in which each object represents a particular state. This is best explained with an example.

Say a customer places an online order for a TV. While this order is being processed it can in one of many states: New, Approved, Packed, Pending, Hold, Shipping, Completed, or Canceled. If all goes well the sequence will be New, Approved, Packed, Shipped, and Completed. However, at any point something unpredictable may happen, such as no inventory, breakage, or customer cancelation. If that happens the order needs to be handled appropriately.
